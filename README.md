# Urho3D_AlchemyAO
Alchemy AO algorithm implemented  with Urho3D Engine By LiuZhiChao 2018/6/15.

this algorithm's implemention is simple as you can just following original article:
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.390.2463&rep=rep1&type=pdf

it will be quick if you have a 3D engine on your hand to get render result, I do that with Urho3D which is a
cross_platform 3D engine with great flexibility, you can implement deferred shading like algriothm just with shader and 
xml file which mean you don't need any c++ code deep in engine source code, that is great.
